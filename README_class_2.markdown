# The Official raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide.
### Updated for Swift 5

This style guide is different from others you may see, because the focus is centered on readability for print and the web. We created this style guide to keep the code in our books, tutorials, and starter kits nice and consistent — even though we have many different authors working on the books.

Our overarching goals are clarity, consistency and brevity, in that order.

## Correctness

Strive to make your code compile without warnings. This rule informs many style decisions such as using `#selector` types instead of string literals.

## Using SwiftLint

When writing for raywenderlich.com, you are strongly encouraged — and some teams may require — to use our SwiftLint configuration. See the [SwiftLint Policy](SWIFTLINT.markdown) for more information.

## Naming

Descriptive and consistent naming makes software easier to read and understand. Use the Swift naming conventions described in the [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). Some key takeaways include:

- striving for clarity at the call site
- prioritizing clarity over brevity
- using `camelCase` (not `snake_case`)
- using `UpperCamelCase` for types and protocols, `lowerCamelCase` for everything else
- including all needed words while omitting needless words
- using names based on roles, not types
- sometimes compensating for weak type information
- striving for fluent usage
- beginning factory methods with `make`
- naming methods for their side effects
  - verb methods follow the -ed, -ing rule for the non-mutating version
  - noun methods follow the formX rule for the mutating version
  - boolean types should read like assertions
  - protocols that describe _what something is_ should read as nouns
  - protocols that describe _a capability_ should end in _-able_ or _-ible_
- using terms that don't surprise experts or confuse beginners
- generally avoiding abbreviations
- using precedent for names
- preferring methods and properties to free functions
- casing acronyms and initialisms uniformly up or down
- giving the same base name to methods that share the same meaning
- avoiding overloads on return type
- choosing good parameter names that serve as documentation
- preferring to name the first parameter instead of including its name in the method name, except as mentioned under Delegates
- labeling closure and tuple parameters
- taking advantage of default parameters

### Prose
 

## Closure Expressions

Use trailing closure syntax only if there's a single closure expression parameter at the end of the argument list. Give the closure parameters descriptive names.

**Preferred**:
```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0) {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}

UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}, completion: { finished in
  self.myView.removeFromSuperview()
})
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
})

UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}) { f in
  self.myView.removeFromSuperview()
}
```

For single-expression closures where the context is clear, use implicit returns:

```swift
attendeeList.sort { a, b in
  a > b
}
```

Chained methods using trailing closures should be clear and easy to read in context. Decisions on spacing, line breaks, and when to use named versus anonymous arguments is left to the discretion of the author. Examples:

```swift
let value = numbers.map { $0 * 2 }.filter { $0 % 3 == 0 }.index(of: 90)

let value = numbers
  .map {$0 * 2}
  .filter {$0 > 50}
  .map {$0 + 10}
```

## Types

Always use Swift's native types and expressions when available. Swift offers bridging to Objective-C so you can still use the full set of methods as needed.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = "\(width)"                         // String
```

**Less Preferred**:
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = (width as NSNumber).stringValue    // String
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let width: NSNumber = 120.0                          // NSNumber
let widthString: NSString = width.stringValue        // NSString
```

In drawing code, use `CGFloat` if it makes the code more succinct by avoiding too many conversions.

### Constants

Constants are defined using the `let` keyword and variables with the `var` keyword. Always use `let` instead of `var` if the value of the variable will not change.

**Tip:** A good technique is to define everything using `let` and only change it to `var` if the compiler complains!

You can define constants on a type rather than on an instance of that type using type properties. To declare a type property as a constant simply use `static let`. Type properties declared in this way are generally preferred over global constants because they are easier to distinguish from instance properties. Example:

**Preferred**:
```swift
enum Math {
  static let e = 2.718281828459045235360287
  static let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872
}

let hypotenuse = side * Math.root2

```
**Note:** The advantage of using a case-less enumeration is that it can't accidentally be instantiated and works as a pure namespace.

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let e = 2.718281828459045235360287  // pollutes global namespace
let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872

let hypotenuse = side * root2 // what is root2?
```

### Static Methods and Variable Type Properties

Static methods and type properties work similarly to global functions and global variables and should be used sparingly. They are useful when functionality is scoped to a particular type or when Objective-C interoperability is required.

### Optionals

Declare variables and function return types as optional with `?` where a `nil` value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized later before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `viewDidLoad()`. Prefer optional binding to implicitly unwrapped optionals in most other cases.

When accessing an optional value, use optional chaining if the value is only accessed once or if there are many optionals in the chain:

```swift
textContainer?.textLabel?.setNeedsDisplay()
```

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = textContainer {
  // do many things with textContainer
}
```

When naming optional variables and properties, avoid naming them like `optionalString` or `maybeView` since their optional-ness is already in the type declaration.

For optional binding, shadow the original name whenever possible rather than using names like `unwrappedView` or `actualLabel`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
var subview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

// later on...
if let subview = subview, let volume = volume {
  // do something with unwrapped subview and volume
}

// another example
resource.request().onComplete { [weak self] response in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  let model = self.updateModel(response)
  self.updateUI(model)
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
  if let realVolume = volume {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview and realVolume
  }
}

// another example
UIView.animate(withDuration: 2.0) { [weak self] in
  guard let strongSelf = self else { return }
  strongSelf.alpha = 1.0
}
```

### Lazy Initialization

Consider using lazy initialization for finer grained control over object lifetime. This is especially true for `UIViewController` that loads views lazily. You can either use a closure that is immediately called `{ }()` or call a private factory method. Example:

```swift
lazy var locationManager = makeLocationManager()

private func makeLocationManager() -> CLLocationManager {
  let manager = CLLocationManager()
  manager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest
  manager.delegate = self
  manager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
  return manager
}
```

**Notes:**
  - `[unowned self]` is not required here. A retain cycle is not created.
  - Location manager has a side-effect for popping up UI to ask the user for permission so fine grain control makes sense here.


### Type Inference

Prefer compact code and let the compiler infer the type for constants or variables of single instances. Type inference is also appropriate for small, non-empty arrays and dictionaries. When required, specify the specific type such as `CGFloat` or `Int16`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let message = "Click the button"
let currentBounds = computeViewBounds()
var names = ["Mic", "Sam", "Christine"]
let maximumWidth: CGFloat = 106.5
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let message: String = "Click the button"
let currentBounds: CGRect = computeViewBounds()
var names = [String]()
```

#### Type Annotation for Empty Arrays and Dictionaries

For empty arrays and dictionaries, use type annotation. (For an array or dictionary assigned to a large, multi-line literal, use type annotation.)

**Preferred**:
```swift
var names: [String] = []
var lookup: [String: Int] = [:]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var names = [String]()
var lookup = [String: Int]()
```

**NOTE**: Following this guideline means picking descriptive names is even more important than before.


### Syntactic Sugar

Prefer the shortcut versions of type declarations over the full generics syntax.

**Preferred**:
```swift
var deviceModels: [String]
var employees: [Int: String]
var faxNumber: Int?
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var deviceModels: Array<String>
var employees: Dictionary<Int, String>
var faxNumber: Optional<Int>
```

## Functions vs Methods

Free functions, which aren't attached to a class or type, should be used sparingly. When possible, prefer to use a method instead of a free function. This aids in readability and discoverability.

Free functions are most appropriate when they aren't associated with any particular type or instance.

**Preferred**
```swift
let sorted = items.mergeSorted()  // easily discoverable
rocket.launch()  // acts on the model
```

**Not Preferred**
```swift
let sorted = mergeSort(items)  // hard to discover
launch(&rocket)
```

**Free Function Exceptions**
```swift
let tuples = zip(a, b)  // feels natural as a free function (symmetry)
let value = max(x, y, z)  // another free function that feels natural
```

## Memory Management

Code (even non-production, tutorial demo code) should not create reference cycles. Analyze your object graph and prevent strong cycles with `weak` and `unowned` references. Alternatively, use value types (`struct`, `enum`) to prevent cycles altogether.

### Extending object lifetime

Extend object lifetime using the `[weak self]` and `guard let self = self else { return }` idiom. `[weak self]` is preferred to `[unowned self]` where it is not immediately obvious that `self` outlives the closure. Explicitly extending lifetime is preferred to optional chaining.

**Preferred**
```swift
resource.request().onComplete { [weak self] response in
  guard let self = self else {
    return
  }
  let model = self.updateModel(response)
  self.updateUI(model)
}
```

**Not Preferred**
```swift
// might crash if self is released before response returns
resource.request().onComplete { [unowned self] response in
  let model = self.updateModel(response)
  self.updateUI(model)
}
```

**Not Preferred**
```swift
// deallocate could happen between updating the model and updating UI
resource.request().onComplete { [weak self] response in
  let model = self?.updateModel(response)
  self?.updateUI(model)
}
```

## Access Control

Full access control annotation in tutorials can distract from the main topic and is not required. Using `private` and `fileprivate` appropriately, however, adds clarity and promotes encapsulation. Prefer `private` to `fileprivate`; use `fileprivate` only when the compiler insists.

Only explicitly use `open`, `public`, and `internal` when you require a full access control specification.

Use access control as the leading property specifier. The only things that should come before access control are the `static` specifier or attributes such as `@IBAction`, `@IBOutlet` and `@discardableResult`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
private let message = "Great Scott!"

class TimeMachine {  
  private dynamic lazy var fluxCapacitor = FluxCapacitor()
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
fileprivate let message = "Great Scott!"

class TimeMachine {  
  lazy dynamic private var fluxCapacitor = FluxCapacitor()
}
```

## Control Flow

Prefer the `for-in` style of `for` loop over the `while-condition-increment` style.

**Preferred**:
```swift
for _ in 0..<3 {
  print("Hello three times")
}

for (index, person) in attendeeList.enumerated() {
  print("\(person) is at position #\(index)")
}

for index in stride(from: 0, to: items.count, by: 2) {
  print(index)
}

for index in (0...3).reversed() {
  print(index)
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var i = 0
while i < 3 {
  print("Hello three times")
  i += 1
}


var i = 0
while i < attendeeList.count {
  let person = attendeeList[i]
  print("\(person) is at position #\(i)")
  i += 1
}
```

### Ternary Operator

The Ternary operator, `?:` , should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness. A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated. Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an `if` statement or refactored into instance variables. In general, the best use of the ternary operator is during assignment of a variable and deciding which value to use.

**Preferred**:

```swift
let value = 5
result = value != 0 ? x : y

let isHorizontal = true
result = isHorizontal ? x : y
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
result = a > b ? x = c > d ? c : d : y
```

## Golden Path

When coding with conditionals, the left-hand margin of the code should be the "golden" or "happy" path. That is, don't nest `if` statements. Multiple return statements are OK. The `guard` statement is built for this.

**Preferred**:
```swift
func computeFFT(context: Context?, inputData: InputData?) throws -> Frequencies {
  guard let context = context else {
    throw FFTError.noContext
  }
  guard let inputData = inputData else {
    throw FFTError.noInputData
  }

  // use context and input to compute the frequencies
  return frequencies
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
func computeFFT(context: Context?, inputData: InputData?) throws -> Frequencies {
  if let context = context {
    if let inputData = inputData {
      // use context and input to compute the frequencies

      return frequencies
    } else {
      throw FFTError.noInputData
    }
  } else {
    throw FFTError.noContext
  }
}
```

When multiple optionals are unwrapped either with `guard` or `if let`, minimize nesting by using the compound version when possible. In the compound version, place the `guard` on its own line, then indent each condition on its own line. The `else` clause is indented to match the `guard` itself, as shown below. Example:

**Preferred**:
```swift
guard 
  let number1 = number1,
  let number2 = number2,
  let number3 = number3 
else {
  fatalError("impossible")
}
// do something with numbers
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
if let number1 = number1 {
  if let number2 = number2 {
    if let number3 = number3 {
      // do something with numbers
    } else {
      fatalError("impossible")
    }
  } else {
    fatalError("impossible")
  }
} else {
  fatalError("impossible")
}
```

### Failing Guards

Guard statements are required to exit in some way. Generally, this should be simple one line statement such as `return`, `throw`, `break`, `continue`, and `fatalError()`. Large code blocks should be avoided. If cleanup code is required for multiple exit points, consider using a `defer` block to avoid cleanup code duplication.

## Semicolons

Swift does not require a semicolon after each statement in your code. They are only required if you wish to combine multiple statements on a single line.

Do not write multiple statements on a single line separated with semicolons.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let swift = "not a scripting language"
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let swift = "not a scripting language";
```

**NOTE**: Swift is very different from JavaScript, where omitting semicolons is [generally considered unsafe](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/444080/do-you-recommend-using-semicolons-after-every-statement-in-javascript)

## Parentheses

Parentheses around conditionals are not required and should be omitted.

**Preferred**:
```swift
if name == "Hello" {
  print("World")
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
if (name == "Hello") {
  print("World")
}
```

In larger expressions, optional parentheses can sometimes make code read more clearly.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let playerMark = (player == current ? "X" : "O")
```

## Multi-line String Literals

When building a long string literal, you're encouraged to use the multi-line string literal syntax. Open the literal on the same line as the assignment but do not include text on that line. Indent the text block one additional level.

**Preferred**:

```swift
let message = """
  You cannot charge the flux \
  capacitor with a 9V battery.
  You must use a super-charger \
  which costs 10 credits. You currently \
  have \(credits) credits available.
  """
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
let message = """You cannot charge the flux \
  capacitor with a 9V battery.
  You must use a super-charger \
  which costs 10 credits. You currently \
  have \(credits) credits available.
  """
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
let message = "You cannot charge the flux " +
  "capacitor with a 9V battery.\n" +
  "You must use a super-charger " +
  "which costs 10 credits. You currently " +
  "have \(credits) credits available."
```

## No Emoji

Do not use emoji in your projects. For those readers who actually type in their code, it's an unnecessary source of friction. While it may be cute, it doesn't add to the learning and it interrupts the coding flow for these readers.

## No #imageLiteral or #colorLiteral

Likewise, do not use Xcode's ability to drag a color or an image into a source statement. These turn into #colorLiteral and #imageLiteral, respectively, and present unpleasant challenges for a reader trying to enter them based on tutorial text. Instead, use `UIColor(red:green:blue)` and `UIImage(imageLiteralResourceName:)`.

## Organization and Bundle Identifier

Where an Xcode project is involved, the organization should be set to `Ray Wenderlich` and the Bundle Identifier set to `com.raywenderlich.TutorialName` where `TutorialName` is the name of the tutorial project.

## Smiley Face

Smiley faces are a very prominent style feature of the [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) site! It is very important to have the correct smile signifying the immense amount of happiness and excitement for the coding topic. The closing square bracket `]` is used because it represents the largest smile able to be captured using ASCII art. A closing parenthesis `)` creates a half-hearted smile, and thus is not preferred.

**Preferred**:
```

**Not Preferred**:
